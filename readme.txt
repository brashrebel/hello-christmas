== Description ==

So for most of the year we can enjoy snippets of a classic jazz tune displayed in our dashboard. But when the holiday season rolls around and you are feeling the Christmas spirit, this little plugin presents a nice alternative.

When activated this plugin checks to make sure Hello Dolly is NOT activated and if that is the case, displays random lyrics from popular Christmas songs in the upper right hand corner of the admin screen.



== Installation ==



Using this plugin is very simple. All you have to do is:


1. Upload the `hello-christmas` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

1. Make sure that 'Hello Dolly' is NOT active

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

1. Look in the upper right corner of your screen and rejoice!
